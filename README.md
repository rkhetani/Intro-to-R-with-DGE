# Introduction to R and differential gene expression (DGE) analysis

### Description
This repository has teaching materials for a **3-day**, hands-on **Introduction to R and differential gene expression (DGE) analysis** workshop. The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio and their application to differential gene expression analysis on RNA-seq count data.

R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. Together, R and RStudio allow participants to wrangle data, plot, and use DESeq2 to obtain lists of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq count data.

This workshop is intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge AND its application. Participants should be interested in:

- using R for increasing their efficiency for data analysis
- visualizing data using R (ggplot2)
- using R to perform statistical analysis on RNA-seq count data to obtain differentially expressed gene lists

### Learning Objectives

- **R syntax:** Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
- **Data structures in R:** Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
- **Data inspection and wrangling:** Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset, merge, and create datasets.
- **Visualizing data:** Visualizing data using plotting functions in base R as well as from external packages such as ggplot2.
- **Exporting data and graphics:** Generating new data tables and plots for use outside of the R environment.
- **Differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data:**
  - QC on count data
  - Using DESeq2 to obtain a list of significantly different genes
  - Visualizing expression patterns of differentially expressed genes
  - Performing functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
